Create a professional AWS architecture diagram for the following workflow:

Application credentials (key/password) are stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

Every 3 months, an EventBridge rule (scheduled event) triggers the process.

The EventBridge rule invokes an SSM Automation Runbook.

The Runbook executes 3 AWS Lambda functions in sequence:

Call Apigee proxy endpoint to generate a new key-secret pair.

Update the new key-secret pair in Secrets Manager.

Call Apigee proxy endpoint to delete the old key-secret pair.

The Runbook sends success/failure status to an SNS Topic.

Amazon SNS notifies users via email with detailed status.

Use standard AWS icons, show the sequential flow, and clearly label each step. Highlight the rotation cycle (every 3 months) and emphasize the integration between EventBridge, SSM Runbook, Lambda functions, Secrets Manager, and SNS."*
