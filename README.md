Domain Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to designing and building software where the focus is on accurately expressing business rules in isolation from other technical concerns
Ubiquitous language: This enhances communication, reduces misunderstanding, and ensures everyone is working toward the same goals.
A domain consists of several subdomains that refer to different parts of the business logic. For example, an online retail store could have a product catalog, inventory, and delivery as its subdomains.
