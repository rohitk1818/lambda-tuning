Subject: Request for Reimbursement â€“ Uber Fare Due to Cab Delay

Dear [Recipient's Name / Admin Team],

I would like to inform you that due to an issue caused by the transport team today, my scheduled office cab was delayed by over an hour. Upon contacting the helpdesk, I was advised to arrange my own transportation to ensure timely arrival at the office.

Accordingly, I booked an Uber for the commute. I am writing to request reimbursement for the fare incurred. Please find the relevant trip details and receipt attached for your reference.

Let me know if any additional information is required from my end.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
