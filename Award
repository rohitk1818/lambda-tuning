Proposed Solution (Automation)
To eliminate the challenges of the manual process, we have automated the entire credential management workflow by leveraging APIGEE’s exposed APIs and AWS integration.
How the Automated Solution Works
APIGEE Exposed APIs
APIGEE provides standard APIs such as:
POST API → to create new credentials (Key ID and Secret).
DELETE API → to delete old credentials.
Instead of requiring the app owner to log in to the APIGEE DIY UI, we directly use these APIs for credential management.
APIGEE Proxy for Automation
A dedicated proxy is created over the APIGEE endpoints.
This proxy internally handles both POST (create) and DELETE (remove) credential calls.
This means the user no longer needs to interact with the DIY UI.
